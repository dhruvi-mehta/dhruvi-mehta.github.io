	<h3> Hello, Welcome to this home page. My name is Dhruvi. I was born in India but I have grown up in Singapore, I have lived here in Singapore for 15 years now.  I graduated from high school in May 2019, I study at Parsons School of Design. I am majoring in Communication Design. My favourite place in New York has to be Seaport in the Financial District, where you are able to see the Brooklyn Bridge and whole city skyline. I really love being in New York City, and wish to go back to New York as soon as possible, and hope we can all adjust to the new normal.</h3>
